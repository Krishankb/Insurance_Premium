# Insurance_Premium
This project is a Insurance premium calculator web application built with Flask, HTML, and MongoDB. It allows users to calculate insurance premiums based on age, city tier, sum insured, tenure, and the option to include children. The calculated premium is displayed, and data is stored in MongoDB for future reference.
